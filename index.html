		<p align="center">Hello!  My name is Cheyenne Buckallew. I am a 27-year-old wife and a mother of 3 wonderful boys! I have recently discovered polymer clay art and started making earrings and hair clips for myself! One night while trying to create something new, I had messed up(being new i have done that more times than getting it right lol) and noticed just how forgiving clay is. You can make a mistake, and just restart. Remold, make some adjustments whatever it may be. This reminded me of Our God. No matter the mistakes nor how many times, you go back to him and restart, remold, listen to his word. it's Grace. How many times have you felt undeserving of it? Or shameful of yourself. Everyone does. Sometimes we need a reminder of that grace and how truly wonderful and beautiful it is. My goal is when you wear a piece of mine, each time you wear it that you know you are a child of God and you are human. You will make mistakes, but guess what? The man on the third cross says you can come. isn't that amazing?! So, I myself am on a journey of learning to give myself Grace, as well as everyone around me! I pray these pieces bring you that piece of mind as well, and I thank you so much for visiting my page! Remember God is sweet even when the world is bitter!<br> <br>
			Let us them approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. <br>- <strong>Hebrews 4:16</strong><br><br>
			But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions-it is by grace you have been saved. <br>-<strong>Ephesians 2:4-5</strong> <br><br>
			For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say "NO" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age.<br>- <strong>Titus 2:11-12</strong></p>
